description: Update the current monthly daily notes file from Reported News and Primary Source developments. Do not use this skill for transcript interpretation or synthesis updates.
---
## Invocation

Use this skill only when explicitly asked to update daily notes or generate the current daily-notes entry. Do not invoke automatically for general news discussion, transcript review, or synthesis work.

## Instructions

Read:
- AGENTS.md
- SOURCES.md
- notes/synthesized_implications.md, if it exists
- the current monthly file in `notes/`
- recent adjacent daily notes files if useful

Then use `SOURCES.md` to identify the **Reported News** sources and any closely linked primary-source items needed to interpret the day’s developments.

Task:
- append one new dated entry to the current monthly file in `notes/`, in reverse chronological order (newest at top)
- if today's date already has an entry in the file, append a second dated block rather than modifying the existing one — do not silently overwrite
- do not rewrite prior entries except to fix an obvious formatting issue
- do not update notes/synthesized_implications.md
- do not process curated transcripts in transcripts/new/

Follow AGENTS.md for:
- structure
- labels
- style
- judgment rules
- hard caps
- idea quality bar
- monthly rollover behavior

Run-specific reminders:
- Be selective.
- Prefer fewer, sharper bullets over broad coverage.
- Only include items that produce a real capability / technology shift, strategic / market implication, meaningful implied idea, a `Watch` item that looks important but is not yet interpretable, or a signal that may point to a missing hypothesis.
- Every bullet should begin with a concrete development or observed fact, even when the point is interpretive.
- Do not create a separate "Major developments" section.
- Put the signal label at the end of the bullet.
- Empty sections are allowed.
- If the synthesis file is thin or absent, rely more on recent daily notes and use `[Watch]` more often. If there are no active hypotheses, `[Reinforcing]` and `[Challenging]` apply only relative to candidate hypotheses or clear patterns in recent daily notes — default to `[New]` or `[Watch]` when the hypothesis set is not established enough to test against.
- Do not force every important development into an existing house view.
- Preserve signals that may point to a missing hypothesis, especially if they are repeated, surprising, or not well explained by the current synthesis.
- Prefer bullets that help test or update an active or candidate hypothesis.
- Keep this skill focused on observed developments, not curated opinion sources.

At the end, provide a short changelog:
- what was added
- which points looked `[New]`, `[Reinforcing]`, `[Challenging]`, or `[Watch]`
- which active or candidate hypotheses the most important points map to, if any
- whether any development may point to a missing or underdeveloped hypothesis
- whether anything looks important enough to consider for synthesis
